On April 7, 2025, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced that it had officially issued regulatory guidelines to licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong regarding their provision of staking services. At the same time, the SFC provided guidance for regulated virtual asset funds (such as spot Ethereum ETFs) on their participation in staking activities, with the aim of promoting the development of Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In its press release, the SFC stated:

> The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today issued regulatory guidelines to licensed virtual asset trading platforms regarding their provision of staking services, as well as guidance to SFC-authorized funds investing in virtual assets (virtual asset funds) on their participation in staking activities.

This move signifies the SFC’s clear recognition of staking’s contribution to blockchain security—enhancing the security of blockchain networks—while also allowing investors to earn yields from virtual assets within a regulated market environment.

The introduction of this policy means that regulated staking services will soon emerge in Hong Kong, and ETF holders will also be able to earn additional staking rewards.

Hong Kong is the first jurisdiction in the world to introduce a regulatory framework for staking, while the United States has yet to issue any related policy.

On April 10, HashKey Exchange was approved to offer staking services. On April 16, China Asset Management’s Ethereum ETF also received approval from the SFC, making it the first spot ETF product in Hong Kong authorized to offer staking services.
