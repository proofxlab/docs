## Consensus Mechanism

The method by which a blockchain network reaches agreement on the validity of transactions and the addition of new blocks. PoS is one such mechanism, as opposed to Proof of Work (PoW).

## Proof of Stake (PoS)

A consensus algorithm where validators are chosen to create new blocks and verify transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

## Delegation

The act of transferring one's voting power or staking rights to another validator, often used in DPoS systems to allow a participant to support a trusted validator.

## Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

A variation of PoS where stakeholders vote for delegates to represent them in the validation process. The delegates produce blocks on behalf of voters.

## Staking

The process of locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a network to participate in the PoS consensus mechanism. The staked coins are used as collateral for validating blocks and transactions.

## Stake

The amount of cryptocurrency a participant locks in the network as collateral to have a chance of being selected as a validator.

## Validator

An entity or participant in a PoS network who validates transactions and produces new blocks. Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they have staked.

## Validator Selection

The process by which a PoS system chooses a validator to create the next block. It is generally based on the amount of cryptocurrency staked, the validator’s reputation, and sometimes randomness.

## Validator Set

A collection of all the validators in a PoS network. The set is typically dynamic, with validators entering and exiting based on their staking activity.

## Delegated Validators

Validators selected through delegation, often found in DPoS systems, where stakeholders vote for a set of trusted delegates who perform the validation.

## Slashing

A penalty imposed on a validator for dishonest behavior or failure to fulfill their duties. This often involves the loss of part or all of their staked coins.

## Finality

A state in which a transaction or block cannot be altered or reverted. In PoS, finality is achieved once a block has been validated and accepted by a sufficient number of validators.

## Network Attack (e.g., Nothing-at-Stake Problem)

A vulnerability in PoS networks where validators have no cost to validate multiple conflicting chains, potentially leading to security issues. This is often mitigated by slashing and other mechanisms.

## Bonding Curve

A mechanism in some PoS networks that defines the relationship between the amount staked and the rewards or penalties. It often aims to incentivize more participants in the system.

## Staking Pool

A collective pool where multiple participants combine their stakes to increase their chances of being selected as a validator. The rewards are then distributed proportionally among the pool participants.

## Epoch

A period of time in which a set of validators is responsible for validating and producing blocks. Epochs often play a role in delegating and re-selecting validators.

## Block Reward

The incentive given to validators for successfully creating and adding a new block to the blockchain. It can consist of newly minted coins or transaction fees.

## Rewards Distribution

The process of distributing block rewards to validators based on their participation in the validation process, staking amount, and overall performance.

## Double Signing

A malicious or faulty behavior where a validator signs two conflicting blocks at the same height. This is typically punished by slashing and may lead to removal from the validator set.

## Downtime

When a validator is offline or fails to participate in block validation or voting, they may receive reduced rewards or penalties.

## Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD)

Tokens that represent staked assets and can be used in DeFi applications. LSDs allow users to stake while still maintaining liquidity (e.g., Lido’s stETH, Rocket Pool’s rETH).

## Re-Staking

The process of using staked assets or LSDs as collateral or stake in other protocols, often to compound rewards or increase security participation.

## APR/APY

Annual Percentage Rate / Annual Percentage Yield — metrics that show staking returns over time, with APY including the effect of compounding.

## Validator Commission

A fee that validators charge on staking rewards earned by delegators, usually expressed as a percentage.
