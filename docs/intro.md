# Proofss Intro

Proofss is focused on the **innovation of PoS ecosystem**.

## What is PoS

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism used in cryptocurrencies to validate transactions and secure the network. Instead of using energy-intensive mining like Proof of Work (PoW), PoS relies on validators who lock up (or "stake") their coins as collateral to be chosen to validate new transactions.

### Benefits of PoS

- ✅ Energy-efficient – No need for high-power mining hardware.
- ✅ More decentralized – Reduces centralization risks since anyone with coins can participate.
- ✅ Scalability – Allows for faster transactions and lower fees.

Popular PoS-based cryptocurrencies include Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL).

## Who is Proofss

We are a team dedicated to innovation in the PoS ecosystem. We believe PoS is the future of blockchain, and more and more projects will adopt the PoS consensus mechanism in the future.  

We are committed to providing infrastructure and services for the PoS ecosystem. Through technological innovation and community collaboration, we aim to drive the growth of the PoS ecosystem.

## What We Build

### Education of PoS

We are dedicated to the promotion and education of PoS (Proof of Stake) knowledge:

- **Basic Knowledge Dissemination**: Explaining the fundamental principles of PoS, its consensus mechanism, and comparisons with PoW (Proof of Work).  
- **Technical Tutorials**: How to set up a PoS node, the role of validators, and methods of staking.  
- **Security and Risks**: Potential attack vectors under the PoS mechanism (such as long-range attacks and Sybil attacks) and corresponding countermeasures.  
- **Ecosystem Development**: The current state of the PoS ecosystem, future trends, and how to get involved.

### Stake as a Service

We offer a variety of services related to PoS staking:

1. Setting up network nodes  
2. Guiding individuals or institutions on how to stake  
3. Building PoS staking pools or LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives) protocols  
4. Technical consulting on PoS  

### LSD Protocol

We build PoS LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives) protocols on major blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Conflux to make staking more accessible for everyday users.

### PoS Hub

[PoS Hub](./PoS-hub.md) is an aggregated platform for the PoS ecosystem. It provides access to PoS staking pools and LSD protocols across multiple networks, allowing users to stake in one place and conveniently view their staking rewards across different blockchains.
